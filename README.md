# Sync to Slides
### Sync your Sketch artboards to Google Slides with ease

Sync to Slides is a Sketch plugin that will help you upload your artboards to Google Slides directly without an export step

## Things to know

- Slides API have limited request payload sizes. Don't expect the plugin to work if you sync 50 artboards with ton of layers at a time. The workaround can be select max of 10 artboards at a time.
- You can also lock the layer if you don't want that layer to be exported for targeted commenting. Locking layers that don't need commenting support will drastically decrease the sync time.
- If you don't want commenting support at all, goto settings and say no to export layers.
